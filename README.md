QUESTIONS

1. A researcher wants to examine the relationship between social class and number of books read in a year. The first hundred people were interviewed as they entered a public library in the researcher’s home town. Based on the answers given, the sample is categorised in a fourfold classification of social class: upper middle class/lower middle class/ upper working class/ lower working class. Using Pearson’s r, the level of correlation is found to be 0.73 which is significant at p < 0.001. The researcher concludes that the findings have considerable validity, especially since 73 per cent of the variance in number of books read is explained by social class. Assess the researcher’s analysis and conclusions.

2. A researcher finds that the correlation between income and a scale measuring interest in work is 0.55 (Pearson’s r) which is non-significant since p is greater than 0.05. This finding is compared to another study using the same variables and measures which found the correlation to be 0.46 and p < 0.001. How could this contrast arise? In other words, how could the larger correlation be non-significant and the smaller correlation be significant?


INTRODUCTION
     In research, statistical methods such as correlation coefficients examine universal 
relationships between variables. This analysis demonstrated where Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient (Pearson’s r) is used to study relationships between variables: Social class, the number of books read, and income and interest in work. 
     In the first question, a researcher examined the relationship between social class and the number of books read in a year by interviewing the first hundred people as they went into the public library of the home town of the researcher. A sample is, categorised into four classifications of social classes, is analysed they are: upper middle class, lower middle class, upper working class, and lower working class. This is done using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), in which 0.73 is the correlation was found, which was significant at p < 0.001. The researcher concludes that the number of books read is explained by social class having a variance of 73%.
      In the second question, a researcher confirmed that the correlation between income and scale measuring interest in work was found to be 0.05, which was non-significant where p > 0.05. Another study with the same variables and measures found a smaller correlation of 0.46, 
significant where p< 0.001. This contrast arises despite the larger correlation being nonsignificant and the smaller correlation being significant.
